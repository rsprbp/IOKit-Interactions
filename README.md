#  IOKit-Interactions

Interacting with kernel-level objects or performing privileged operations on macOS.

#  Why

On macOS, system frameworks or particular APIs offered by Apple are usually used to communicate with kernel objects. The above example makes the assumption that device nodes (/dev/...) are utilized for direct kernel interaction in an environment akin to Linux. On macOS, though, this method needs to be modified. You would normally use Apple-provided APIs like IOKit or Kernel.framework to interface with kernel-level objects or to carry out privileged actions. This is an IOKit conceptual example.

#  Info

This application uses the IOKit framework on macOS to communicate between a kernel extension (MyKernelService) and a user-space program (iokit-interactions). Users can manipulate and submit payloads to the kernel for processing through the iokit-interactions. Important features include system command execution, payload manipulation with custom or pattern-based payloads, and message and payload history recording.

How does it interact with the MyKernelService kernel extension? Initially, IOServiceGetMatchingService and IOServiceOpen are used by iokit-interactions to locate and connect to MyKernelService. The manipulateKernelDataWithPayload function uses IOConnectCallMethod to transmit the payload to MyKernelService after preparing a kernel_data_object containing the altered data. With memoryIntegrityCheck, the program guards against unauthorized changes to kernel_data_object, ensuring data integrity. A menu-driven interface (showMenu) facilitates user engagement by providing choices to deliver predefined, bespoke, or pattern-based payloads, run system instructions, and quit. Robustness is facilitated by error handling and logging (logMessage, logPayloadHistory). All things considered, this configuration improves system functionality and security by utilizing macOS's IOKit to enable secure communication between user space and the kernel.

Make sure your application has the necessary permissions to interact with the provided IOKit service before implementing the actual IOKit calls and methods. This needs knowledge of the particular service and methods supplied by your kernel object. You can successfully replicate kernel data manipulation and comprehend the required procedures for mitigation or debugging by modifying your technique to use IOKit or other macOS-specific APIs for kernel interaction. Depending on what has to be done, testing on macOS may require sudo access or other necessary permissions.

#  Features Implemented (WIP):

# Logging Functions (logMessage and logPayloadHistory):
* Goal: Records payload history and messages in the corresponding log files, payload_history.log and iokit-interactions.log.
* Application: Timestamped messages are written to files by functions using fprintf. graciously handles file opening problems.
# Payload Manipulation (encryptDecryptPayload and manipulateKernelDataWithPayload):
* Function: Modifies kernel data objects and encrypts and decrypts payloads.
* Using encryptDecrypt for implementationWhen encrypting or decrypting data, payload XORs the data with ENCRYPTION_KEY. manipulateKernelDataWithPayload uses the payload to determine which kernel_obj data fields (data1, data2, description) to set.
# Custom Payload Input (readCustomPayload):
* Goal: Reads user input to create a bespoke payload.
* Application: To read input from stdin, use getline. returns the payload after removing the trailing newline.
# Pattern-Based Payload Generation (generatePatternPayload):
* Goal: Produces a payload by utilizing a pattern and repeat count entered by the user.
* Application: Sets aside memory for payload, iterates the pattern according to the instructions, and ends with null terminator.
# Sending Payload to Kernel (sendPayloadToKernel):
* Goal: Delivers the ready-to-use payload to the kernel service.
* Application: To send kernel_obj to the MyKernelService, use the IOConnectCallMethod. applies retry logic (MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS) in the event of an error.
# Memory Integrity Check (memoryIntegrityCheck):
* Goal: Provides kernel_obj with memory protection.
* Application: Read-only protection for kernel_obj is set via mprotect.
# Executing System Command (executeSystemCommand):
* Goal: Executes a system command.
* Application: Uses system to execute commands and logs success/failure messages.
# Menu Display (showMenu):
* Goal: Displays a menu for user interaction.
* Application: Prints choices to run system commands, transmit custom, predefined payloads based on patterns, and exit.
# Threaded Payload Sending (threadedSendPayload):
* Goal: Sends payload to kernel in a separate thread.
* Application: uses IOServiceOpen to open MyKernelService on a different thread and sends kernel_obj.
# Interaction with plist (Info.plist) and MyKernelService:
* Info.plist: gives application metadata, including version and bundle identifier. MacOS needs to recognize and control the application.
* MyKernelService: represents the com.example.MyKernelService kernel-level service that your user-space application uses to interact via IOKit.

# Points of integration (WIP):

# Service Matching (IOServiceMatching(SERVICE_NAME)):
* Uses IOServiceGetMatchingService and IOServiceOpen to locate and communicate with MyKernelService.
# IOConnectCallMethod:
* Sends kernel_obj via calling methods on MyKernelService.
# Logging and Security:
* Logging features make sure that actions are recorded for auditing and troubleshooting.
* After alteration, memory protection (memoryIntegrityCheck) secures kernel_obj.
